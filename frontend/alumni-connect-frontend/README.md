# Alumni Connect Frontend

A comprehensive React-based frontend for the Alumni Connect platform, designed to address the critical problem of scattered alumni data and limited engagement in educational institutions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most educational institutions lack a reliable, centralized system to manage alumni data.
